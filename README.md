## Vue Gaming Room

A basic platform for creating web-based games with a room concept based on Vue.

When entering the game page, the user must specify his nickname, and then create his own or join someone elseâ€™s room, specifying its code. Further behavior of the application depends on the game implementation.

### Usage

- [Scaffold your Vite empty project](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).  
**Select Pinia as state manager.**
- Install necessary dependencies:
```shell
npm install axios @loolzaaa/vue-gaming-room
```
- Replace some predefined variable in Vite config:
```javascript
// vite.config.js

// ... some imports ...
export default defineConfig({
    // ... some properties ...
    // Vue Gaming Room constant replacement
    define: {
        'env.VGR_BASE': 'import.meta.env.BASE_URL'
    }
})
```
- Import Vue Gaming Room styles to your project
```javascript
// main.js
import '@loolzaaa/vue-gaming-room/style'
```
- Import `GamingRoom` component to you `App.vue` and use it in conjunction with your room implementation
```javascript
<script setup>
import { GamingRoom } from '@loolzaaa/vue-gaming-room'

// REQUIRED: This is your room implementation component
import RoomMain from '@/components/RoomMain.vue'

// REQUIRED: This is your room background
import bgImg from '@/assets/bg.jpeg'

// OPTIONAL: This is ypur settings component implementation
import SettingsMain from '@/components/SettingsMain.vue'

// OPTIONAL: Fine-tune background styles
const bgStyles = {
  position: '52% 0',
  opacity: 0.75,
  color: '#000'
}

// OPTIONAL: You can provide link (precedence) or component with game rules
</script>

<template>
  <GamingRoom
    :bgImg="bgImg"
    :bgStyles="bgStyles"
    :roomComp="RoomMain"
    :settingsComp="SettingsMain"
    rulesLink="/rules.pdf"
  >
    <!-- <div class="logo">Some logo for game</div> -->
  </GamingRoom>
</template>
```
- Place some favicon to public folder

### Room implementation props

|Prop name|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`members`|`Array`|`true`|list of room members (players with one admin and spectators)|
|`gameStarted`|`Boolean`|`true`|game started flag|
|`currentMember`|`Object`|`false`|current player/member who has the game running|
|`changeReadyStatus`|`Function`|`true`|function for changing ready/not ready to game status|

### Using State Manager

Import Pinia to your component and use it as usual:
```javascript
import { useRoomStore } from '@loolzaaa/vue-gaming-room'

console.log(store.roomCode) // Example: AFRG
```

#### Pinia Room store properties

|Prop name|Description|
|---|---|
|`gameName`|Current game name|
|`nickname`|Current player nickname|
|`userId`|Current player user id (used for game state receiving from game server)|
|`roomCode`|Current game room code|
|`gameSettings`|Current game settings|
|`webSocket`|WebSocket instance for sending some events|
|`addWsEventHandler`|Function for registering event handlers from game server via WebSocket|

**IMPORTANT!** If you provide settings component, you **must** set initial value of game settings in state manager.

### Change theme colors

You need to install SASS to changing main colors of Vue Gaming Library:
```shell
npm i sass -D
```

After that, you can create some `style.scss` in assets folder and change color variables:
```scss
// Use all component styles from library
@use '@loolzaaa/vue-gaming-room/style';

// Change some variables
@use '@loolzaaa/vue-gaming-room/sass/variables' with (
    $main-color: #b577b5,
    $dark-color: #352233,
);
@use '@loolzaaa/vue-gaming-room/sass';
```

Finally, import created `style.scss` in app entry point:
```diff
// main.js
- import '@loolzaaa/vue-gaming-room/style'
+ import './assets/main.scss'
```
